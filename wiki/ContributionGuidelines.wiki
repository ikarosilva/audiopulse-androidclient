#General Guidelines for contributing to the project.

= Introduction =

This is a brief description of minimal guidelines you should follow when contributing to this project.

1. Creating a new Java file
    A. Follow the general Android coding syntax (ie, general class name should have first letters capitalized, and an instance should have first letter lowercase: eg: general class name: {{{MyClass}}}, instance: {{{myClass}}}, thread classes should have Runnable appended, Activities classes Activity appended, etc...).

    B. Add the license file template [License] to your code. 

2. Modifying Existing Code
   A. Make sure your project is up-to-date with the head revision
   B. Make your changes and make sure your project runs without errors and warnings
   C. If this is a very significant change to the code (ie, API changes, modifying how a function returns, adding functions/constructors), add your name to the list of contributors. Make sure one of the contributors (listed in the code's license file) revises and accepts your changes.
   D. Commit

3. Version Control
   A. Please make sure that the following directories are *not* under version control (svn:ignore in Eclipse/Subversion): 

{{{
AudioPulse/gen
AudioPulse/bin
}}}
